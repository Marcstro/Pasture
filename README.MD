This is a project I did during a course at Uppsala university during 2017, before I began my studies at Nackademin.
As such it's not well written at all, almost completely without guidance or feedback which explains some horrible OOP crimes commited here.
However I am quite pleased with the functionality of the program.
It's a simulation of an environment with wolves eating sheep eating grass. The wolves and sheep need to eat to survive and breed. The grass continuously grows if it's not eaten by sheep.
The initial window lets the user determine the attributes of all the creatures.
